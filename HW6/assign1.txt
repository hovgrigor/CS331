Size of int: 4 bytes
Size of char: 1 bytes
Size of double: 8 bytes
Size of short: 2 bytes

Address of int a: 0x7fff6eb76bfc
Address of char b: 0x7fff6eb76bf9
Address of double c: 0x7fff6eb76c00
Address of short d: 0x7fff6eb76bfa


We can see the sizes of different types of variables.
In the addresses we can see that all of them are a divisible of the size of their respective types.

Fc -> 252 / 4 (int) = 63 
F9 -> 249 / 1 (char) = 249 (no padding needed here)
00 -> 0 / 8 (double) = 0
Fa -> 250 / 2 (short) = 125

As we can see there are paddings between the variables to ensure they are correctly positioned.
