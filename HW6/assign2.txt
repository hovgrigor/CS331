=== Struct 1 (char, int, double) ===
Size of struct: 16 bytes
Address of char: 0x7ffcdb133580
Address of int: 0x7ffcdb133584
Address of double: 0x7ffcdb133588

=== Struct 2 (int, double, char) ===
Size of struct: 24 bytes
Address of int: 0x7ffcdb133590
Address of double: 0x7ffcdb133598
Address of char: 0x7ffcdb1335a0

In the first one we have char (1 byte) at 80 then 3 bytes of padding then int (4 bytes) at 84 and double (8 bytes) at 88 with no padding since its already aligned. 1 + 3 + 4 + 8 = 16
In the second one we have int (4 bytes) at 90 then 4 bytes of padding then double (8 bytes) at 98 then char (1 byte) at a0 and 7 bytes of padding afterwards to make the total multiple of 8. 4 + 4 + 8 + 1 + 7 = 24
